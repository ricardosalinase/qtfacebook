#summary Let's get our todo on.

= Introduction =

Here we can list things that need to be done and who is working on them


= Details =

  * *Wizard section*

    * Determine which style to use. (Currently ModernStyle seems to work fine in Win7 and Linux)
      * option B here would be to code for specific styles, or fix it so it works in both.
    * Add a loading animation/progress bar when waiting for facebook pages to load 
      * This should be easy. There's a couple different signals emitted by QWebkit we can hook into. Basically show our "loading" widget until we get the signal that the inital page load is done, then swap it out for the WebView (m_view) object

  * *Main Application*
  
    * What to do next?
      * My thoughts on the design are to revolve everything around a notification icon that sits in the system tray (windows) / top-bar on linux/OSX
        * There's a chapter in the Qt programming book on safari. I'm about to read it
      * Decide on how to build API requests
        * My thought there was a factory that returned various API call objects. Each would encapsulate the required arguments for each API method, provide setters for them, sanity checking, and then an execute() method. There would also be single QNEtworkAccessManager object (Factory would be singleton?) Thoughts?
      * Start building widgets for displaying various components and allowing for input
